These 3D files are the raw files i used to make my own NTM 28 36 series (1350 kv) 3D printed frame.
This will be mounted inside my planes (Tiny Trainer of Flite Test : https://www.flitetest.com/articles/flite-test-tiny-trainer)

Feel free to modify, share and customize the 3D files as you like.
You will also find a hollow model of the motor (i needed its exact outer dimensions to make sure my design will work in real life).

Enjoy!
