Backpack Buckles 55mm Forclaz 30 Liters (Decathlon's basic buckles)
Original material : pressure injected Nylon

Here are the original CAD files used to create and modify the design of these buckles. 
The CERN Open Hardware License applies to any Hardware related files (CAD and .stl files) while the GNU GPL
license applies to used code. In this particular application, no code were used to make the whole project.

These buckles were designed to match as closely as possible the original design 
of those originally clamped on my backpack. Also, they were designed with 3D printing in mind, 
hence i had to make changes to the primary functional design in the aim to print it better.

One can find the printing instructions on my thingiverse topic :

Enjoy and don't hesitate to share, improve and fork my design to meet your particular need.
